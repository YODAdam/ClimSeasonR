## Introduction

This R package provides tools to estimate key agroclimatic characteristics of the rainy season based on Sivakumar's principle. It allows users to calculate:

- 📅 Start of the season (SOS)
- 📅 End of the season (EOS)
- 🌵 Dry spells at the beginning and end of the season
- 🌧️ Total rainfall during the season
- 📈 Other essential agroclimatic parameters
Designed for researchers, agronomists, and climatologists, this package helps analyze rainfall data to improve crop management and climate risk assessment.
